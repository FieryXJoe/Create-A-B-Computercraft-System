Modded Minecraft server me and friends are working on has programmable computers programmable in Lua.
I decided to have some of my contraptions controlled wirelessly from a central computer in my house.
There is Github integration and this will let me more easily change code in a normal text editor,
and keep track of which files have been changed.
This repository will have a different folder for each computer in the network and the changed files.
